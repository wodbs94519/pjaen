What's wrong with the world, mama 
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas 
I think the whole world addicted to the drama 
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma 
Overseas, yeah, we trying to stop terrorism 
But we still got terrorists here livin' 
In the USA, the big CIA 
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK 
But if you only have love for your own race 
Then you only leave space to discriminate 
And to discriminate only generates hate 
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah 
Madness is what you demonstrate 
And that's exactly how anger works and operates 
Nig, you gotta have love just to set it straight 
Take control of your mind and meditate 
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all 

People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurt and hear them cryin' 
Can you practice what you preach 
And would you turn the other cheek 

Father, Father, Father help us 
Send us some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love (Love) 

Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love (The love) 
Where is the love 
The love, the love <pre>
